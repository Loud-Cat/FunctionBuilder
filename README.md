# MathWindow
A Tkinter-based GUI for quickly visualizing math equations

Feel free to use this! It was just for fun.
The only required module is `matplotlib` since `math` is builtin.

# Usage
It's pretty easy to use: enter the graph title in the "Title:" box, and the function performed on x in the "Function:" box.
For example:
```
Title: Sine of x
Function: sin(x)
```
After entering your info, click "Submit!" to add that equation to the list of equations. When you click it, every equation will load on the graph.
To clear the graph, click "Clear all graphs"
